# SSH Watchdog Installation Guide

## 1) Install Extension (Local User)

Use the UUID from `extension/metadata.json` (current: `ssh-watchdog@miguelregueiro.github.io`):

```bash
UUID="ssh-watchdog@miguelregueiro.github.io"
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/$UUID"
cp -r extension/* "$HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/$UUID/"
glib-compile-schemas "$HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/$UUID/schemas"
```

Then reload GNOME Shell (X11: `Alt+F2`, type `r`) or log out/log in, and enable the extension.
On Wayland sessions, log out/log in (the `Alt+F2` reload path is X11-only).

## 2) Notes

- SSH server must be active (`sshd`).
- Extension session source is `who` (deduplicated unique IPv4 endpoints).
- `grep -P` support is required for the extension parser.
- Notifications are generated by GNOME Shell directly from the extension (`Main.notify`).
- When schema files change, re-run `glib-compile-schemas` for the extension `schemas/` directory.
- Visual Verification: The top-bar indicator is now precision-centered for a native GNOME look; after enabling, confirm the icon/count pill appears visually balanced under the panel item.
- Preferences are available from GNOME Extensions/Extension Manager:
  - Refresh interval (`1-60` seconds)
  - Show icon toggle
